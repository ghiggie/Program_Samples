#Movie Library: First Version

This is the first version of my library code. The biggest flaw in the code is that the code will fail if the file movie_library.json does not already exist. If you force close the program, this file will be permanently deleted with no backups. Aside from this major flaw, the code works fine, even if it isn't very broad.
