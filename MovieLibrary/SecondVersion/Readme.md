# Movie Library: New Version

I intend for this to be a more sophisticated version of the movie library I previously wrote. There will be three major stages to the project:

1. **Core Functionality**

   Movies will be encoded as a class structure, and tenets of OOP will be heavily used, in contrast with the functional approach implemented in the first version of the movie library code. Much of the overall functionality will be the same, but done in a more sophisticated manner. For example, in the previous program you could only search for a movie by knowing the exact name of the film. In this version, an algorithm will be implemented that will allow for partial name matches, as well as searching amongst over movie descriptors. A later stage goal will be the implementation of a webscraper to automatically populate movie descriptors from IMDB.

2. **User Interface**

   Tkinter will be used to build a basic user-friendly interface.

3. **Windows Executable**

   Using pyinstaller, a Windows executable will be created from the Python script so that users will have an easier time actually using the program.
